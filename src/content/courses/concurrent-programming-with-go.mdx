# Concurrent Programming with Go

Welcome to the Concurrent Programming with Go course! In this course, you'll learn how to write concurrent programs using Go's powerful concurrency primitives.

## What You'll Learn

- Understanding concurrency versus parallelism
- Working with goroutines and channels
- Synchronization techniques using WaitGroups and Mutexes
- Common concurrency patterns in Go
- Best practices for concurrent programming
- Error handling in concurrent code
- Testing concurrent programs

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:

- Basic knowledge of Go programming language
- Understanding of functions, structs, and interfaces in Go
- Familiarity with Go's error handling

Let's explore how Go's concurrency model makes it easy to write concurrent programs that are both efficient and easy to reason about!
