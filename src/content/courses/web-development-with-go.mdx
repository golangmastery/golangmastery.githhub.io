# Web Development with Go

Welcome to the Web Development with Go course! This course will teach you how to build web applications and APIs using Go.

## What You'll Learn

In this course, you'll learn:

- How to create HTTP servers using Go's standard library
- Routing and handling HTTP requests
- Working with JSON data
- Connecting to databases
- Designing and implementing RESTful APIs

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this course, you should have:

- Basic knowledge of Go programming
- Understanding of functions and data structures in Go
- Familiarity with error handling in Go
- Basic understanding of HTTP and web concepts

If you're new to Go, we recommend completing the "Quick Start with Golang" course first.

## Why Web Development with Go?

Go is an excellent language for web development for several reasons:

- **Performance**: Go is compiled to machine code, making it very fast.
- **Concurrency**: Go's goroutines and channels make it easy to handle multiple requests simultaneously.
- **Standard Library**: Go's standard library includes a powerful HTTP package.
- **Simplicity**: Go's simple syntax and strong typing help prevent bugs.
- **Deployment**: Go compiles to a single binary, making deployment easy.

## Course Structure

The course consists of 5 interactive labs, each focusing on a specific aspect of web development with Go. Each lab includes:

- Theoretical explanations
- Code examples
- Hands-on exercises
- Challenges to test your understanding

## Getting Started

To get started, click on the first lab: "HTTP Server Basics". This will introduce you to creating HTTP servers using Go's standard library.

Happy web development!
