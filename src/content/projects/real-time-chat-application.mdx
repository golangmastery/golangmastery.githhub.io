# Real-time Chat Application

In this project, you'll build a real-time chat application using Go and WebSockets. This project will help you understand how to implement real-time communication between clients and servers.

## Project Overview

You'll create a chat application that allows users to:

- Join chat rooms
- Send messages to all users in a room
- Receive messages in real-time
- See who is online in a room
- Leave chat rooms

## What You'll Learn

By completing this project, you'll learn:

- How to use WebSockets in Go
- How to handle concurrent connections
- How to broadcast messages to multiple clients
- How to manage chat rooms and users
- How to create a simple web interface for the chat

## Prerequisites

To complete this project, you should have:

- Basic knowledge of Go programming
- Understanding of HTTP and web concepts
- Familiarity with concurrency in Go
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Project Structure

The project is divided into several steps:

1. Setting up the project
2. Implementing the WebSocket server
3. Creating chat rooms and user management
4. Handling messages and broadcasting
5. Building a web interface
6. Testing and refining the application

## Getting Started

Let's start by setting up the project and implementing the WebSocket server.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "net/http"
    "github.com/gorilla/websocket"
)

var upgrader = websocket.Upgrader{
    ReadBufferSize:  1024,
    WriteBufferSize: 1024,
    CheckOrigin: func(r *http.Request) bool {
        return true // Allow all connections
    },
}

type Client struct {
    conn *websocket.Conn
    room string
    username string
}

type Message struct {
    Type    string `json:"type"`
    Content string `json:"content"`
    Sender  string `json:"sender"`
    Room    string `json:"room"`
}

var clients = make(map[*Client]bool)
var broadcast = make(chan Message)

func handleConnections(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Upgrade initial GET request to a WebSocket
    ws, err := upgrader.Upgrade(w, r, nil)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    defer ws.Close()

    // Create a new client
    client := &Client{conn: ws, room: "general", username: "anonymous"}
    clients[client] = true

    // We'll implement the message handling here
}

func handleMessages() {
    for {
        // Grab the next message from the broadcast channel
        msg := <-broadcast

        // Send it out to every client
        for client := range clients {
            if client.room == msg.Room {
                err := client.conn.WriteJSON(msg)
                if err != nil {
                    log.Printf("error: %v", err)
                    client.conn.Close()
                    delete(clients, client)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

func main() {
    // Create a simple file server
    fs := http.FileServer(http.Dir("./public"))
    http.Handle("/", fs)

    // Configure WebSocket route
    http.HandleFunc("/ws", handleConnections)

    // Start listening for incoming chat messages
    go handleMessages()

    // Start the server
    fmt.Println("Server starting at localhost:8080")
    err := http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal("ListenAndServe: ", err)
    }
}
```

Follow the step-by-step instructions in this project to build your own real-time chat application!
