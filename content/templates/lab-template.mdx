# Lab Title Here

<Callout type="info">
  This lab will guide you through [brief description of what the student will learn/build].
</Callout>

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Objective 1
- Objective 2
- Objective 3

## Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, you should:

- Have a basic understanding of Go syntax
- Be familiar with [specific concept]
- Have completed the [previous lab name] lab

## Introduction

Provide a brief introduction to the topic of the lab. Explain why it's important and how it fits into the larger context of Go programming.

## Setup

<Step number="1" title="Set up your environment">
  First, make sure you have Go installed on your system. You can check by running:

  <Terminal>
  go version
  </Terminal>

  If Go is not installed, follow the instructions on the [official Go website](https://golang.org/doc/install).
</Step>

<Step number="2" title="Create a new project">
  Create a new directory for your project and initialize a Go module:

  <Terminal>
  mkdir my-project
  cd my-project
  go mod init example.com/my-project
  </Terminal>

  This will create a new Go module with the specified module path.
</Step>

## Main Content

<Step number="3" title="Create your first file">
  Create a new file called `main.go` with the following content:

  ```go
  package main

  import (
      "fmt"
  )

  func main() {
      fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
  }
  ```

  This is a simple Go program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
</Step>

<Step number="4" title="Run your program">
  Run your program using the `go run` command:

  <Terminal>
  go run main.go
  </Terminal>

  You should see the output:

  <Terminal>
  Hello, World!
  </Terminal>
</Step>

## Explanation

<Callout type="info" title="How it works">
  Explain the key concepts used in the code above. For example:
  
  - The `package main` declaration indicates this is an executable program
  - The `import` statement brings in the `fmt` package for formatted I/O
  - The `main()` function is the entry point of the program
</Callout>

## Exercises

Now it's your turn to practice what you've learned. Complete the following exercises:

### Exercise 1: Modify the program

Modify the program to print your name instead of "Hello, World!".

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

  ```go
  package main

  import (
      "fmt"
  )

  func main() {
      fmt.Println("Hello, [Your Name]!")
  }
  ```
</details>

### Exercise 2: Add more functionality

Extend the program to ask for the user's name and then greet them.

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

  ```go
  package main

  import (
      "bufio"
      "fmt"
      "os"
      "strings"
  )

  func main() {
      reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)
      fmt.Print("Enter your name: ")
      name, _ := reader.ReadString('\n')
      name = strings.TrimSpace(name)
      fmt.Printf("Hello, %s!\n", name)
  }
  ```
</details>

## Challenge (Optional)

For an extra challenge, try to implement a program that:

- Takes a list of names as command-line arguments
- Greets each person in the list
- Counts and displays the total number of people greeted

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

  ```go
  package main

  import (
      "fmt"
      "os"
  )

  func main() {
      names := os.Args[1:]
      
      if len(names) == 0 {
          fmt.Println("No names provided")
          return
      }
      
      for _, name := range names {
          fmt.Printf("Hello, %s!\n", name)
      }
      
      fmt.Printf("Greeted %d people\n", len(names))
  }
  ```
</details>
