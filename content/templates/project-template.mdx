# Project Title Here

<Callout type="info">
  In this project, you'll build [brief description of what the student will build].
</Callout>

## Project Overview

Provide a brief overview of the project, including:

- What the student will build
- What skills they will practice
- What the final result will look like
- Why this project is valuable for learning

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Objective 1
- Objective 2
- Objective 3

## Prerequisites

Before starting this project, you should:

- Have a solid understanding of Go fundamentals
- Be familiar with [specific concept]
- Have completed the [prerequisite lab name] lab

## Project Structure

Here's an overview of the project structure:

<FileTree>
project-name/
├── cmd/
│   └── main.go
├── internal/
│   ├── handlers/
│   │   └── handlers.go
│   ├── models/
│   │   └── models.go
│   └── service/
│       └── service.go
├── go.mod
└── go.sum
</FileTree>

## Getting Started

<Step number="1" title="Set up your environment">
  First, make sure you have Go installed on your system. You can check by running:

  <Terminal>
  go version
  </Terminal>

  If Go is not installed, follow the instructions on the [official Go website](https://golang.org/doc/install).
</Step>

<Step number="2" title="Create a new project">
  Create a new directory for your project and initialize a Go module:

  <Terminal>
  mkdir project-name
  cd project-name
  go mod init example.com/project-name
  </Terminal>

  This will create a new Go module with the specified module path.
</Step>

## Implementation

<Step number="3" title="Create the main file">
  Create a new file at `cmd/main.go` with the following content:

  ```go
  package main

  import (
      "fmt"
      "log"
      "net/http"
  )

  func main() {
      http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
          fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, World!")
      })

      log.Println("Server starting on :8080")
      log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
  }
  ```

  This creates a simple HTTP server that responds with "Hello, World!" on the root path.
</Step>

<Step number="4" title="Create the models">
  Create a new file at `internal/models/models.go` with the following content:

  ```go
  package models

  // Item represents an item in our application
  type Item struct {
      ID          string `json:"id"`
      Name        string `json:"name"`
      Description string `json:"description"`
      CreatedAt   string `json:"created_at"`
  }
  ```

  This defines the data model for our application.
</Step>

<Step number="5" title="Run your application">
  Run your application using the `go run` command:

  <Terminal>
  go run cmd/main.go
  </Terminal>

  You should see the output:

  <Terminal>
  Server starting on :8080
  </Terminal>

  You can now access your application at http://localhost:8080
</Step>

## Testing

<Step number="6" title="Write tests for your application">
  Create a new file at `internal/models/models_test.go` with the following content:

  ```go
  package models

  import (
      "testing"
  )

  func TestItem(t *testing.T) {
      item := Item{
          ID:          "1",
          Name:        "Test Item",
          Description: "This is a test item",
          CreatedAt:   "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      }

      if item.ID != "1" {
          t.Errorf("Expected ID to be 1, got %s", item.ID)
      }

      if item.Name != "Test Item" {
          t.Errorf("Expected Name to be 'Test Item', got %s", item.Name)
      }
  }
  ```

  Run the tests using the `go test` command:

  <Terminal>
  go test ./...
  </Terminal>
</Step>

## Explanation

<Callout type="info" title="How it works">
  Explain the key concepts used in the code above. For example:
  
  - The HTTP server is created using Go's standard library
  - The models package defines the data structures used in the application
  - The handlers package contains the HTTP request handlers
</Callout>

## Challenges

Now that you've built the basic application, try these challenges to extend it:

### Challenge 1: Add CRUD operations

Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for the `Item` model.

<details>
  <summary>Hint</summary>
  
  You'll need to:
  
  1. Create an in-memory store or connect to a database
  2. Add handlers for each CRUD operation
  3. Implement proper error handling
</details>

### Challenge 2: Add authentication

Add basic authentication to your API.

<details>
  <summary>Hint</summary>
  
  You can use:
  
  1. HTTP Basic Authentication
  2. JWT tokens
  3. A middleware approach to protect routes
</details>

## Deployment (Optional)

If you want to deploy your application, here are some options:

- Deploy to a VPS like DigitalOcean or Linode
- Use a container service like Docker and Kubernetes
- Deploy to a serverless platform like AWS Lambda

## Summary

In this project, you built:

- A web server using Go's standard library
- A simple API with a data model
- Tests for your application

You practiced:

- Structuring a Go application
- Working with HTTP in Go
- Testing Go code

## Next Steps
