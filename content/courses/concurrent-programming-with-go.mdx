# Concurrent Programming with Go

Welcome to the Concurrent Programming with Go course! In this course, you'll learn how to write concurrent programs using Go's powerful concurrency primitives.

## What You'll Learn

- Understanding concurrency versus parallelism
- Working with goroutines and channels
- Synchronization techniques using WaitGroups and Mutexes
- Common concurrency patterns in Go
- Best practices for concurrent programming
- Error handling in concurrent code
- Testing concurrent programs

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:

- Basic knowledge of Go programming language
- Understanding of functions, structs, and interfaces in Go
- Familiarity with Go's error handling

## Course Modules

This course is divided into several modules to help you learn concurrent programming in Go step by step:

1. [Introduction to Concurrency](/courses/concurrent-programming-with-go/introduction-to-concurrency) - Understand concurrency vs parallelism and Go's approach.
2. [Channels Basics](/courses/concurrent-programming-with-go/channels-basics) - Learn about Go's primary communication mechanism.
3. [Bidirectional Channels](/courses/concurrent-programming-with-go/bidirectional-channels) - See how channels can send and receive data.
4. [Directional Channels](/courses/concurrent-programming-with-go/directional-channels) - Learn about send-only and receive-only channels.
5. [Buffered Channels](/courses/concurrent-programming-with-go/buffered-channels) - Work with channels that can store multiple values.
6. [Creating Goroutines](/courses/concurrent-programming-with-go/creating-goroutines) - Launch lightweight threads in Go.
7. [Working with WaitGroups](/courses/concurrent-programming-with-go/working-with-waitgroups) - Coordinate multiple goroutines.
8. [Testing with WaitGroups](/courses/concurrent-programming-with-go/testing-with-waitgroups) - Write tests for concurrent code.
9. [Race Conditions](/courses/concurrent-programming-with-go/race-conditions) - Identify and understand race conditions.
10. [Using Mutex](/courses/concurrent-programming-with-go/using-mutex) - Protect shared resources from concurrent access.
11. [The Producer-Consumer Problem](/courses/concurrent-programming-with-go/producer-consumer-problem) - Solve this classic concurrency challenge.
12. [Range over Channels](/courses/concurrent-programming-with-go/range-over-channels) - Iterate over channel values elegantly.
13. [Unbuffered Channels](/courses/concurrent-programming-with-go/unbuffered-channels) - Understand synchronization with unbuffered channels.
14. [Buffered vs Unbuffered Channels](/courses/concurrent-programming-with-go/buffered-vs-unbuffered) - Compare the two channel types.
15. [Channel Direction](/courses/concurrent-programming-with-go/channel-direction) - Enforce data flow direction.
16. [Channel Ownership](/courses/concurrent-programming-with-go/channel-ownership) - Establish clear ownership patterns.
17. [Pipeline Pattern](/courses/concurrent-programming-with-go/pipeline-pattern) - Process data through a series of stages.
18. [Fan-Out Fan-In Pattern](/courses/concurrent-programming-with-go/fan-out-fan-in) - Distribute and collect work among goroutines.
19. [Cancellation with Context Package](/courses/concurrent-programming-with-go/context-package) - Manage goroutine lifecycles and cancellation.

Let's explore how Go's concurrency model makes it easy to write concurrent programs that are both efficient and easy to reason about!
