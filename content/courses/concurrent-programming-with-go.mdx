# Concurrent Programming with Go

Welcome to Concurrent Programming with Go! This course will teach you how to harness the power of Go's concurrency model to build efficient, concurrent applications.

## What You'll Learn

- Go's goroutines for concurrent execution
- Channels for communication between goroutines
- Synchronization primitives like Mutex and WaitGroup
- Common concurrency patterns
- Detecting and fixing race conditions
- Creating efficient concurrent algorithms
- Best practices for concurrent programming

## Prerequisites

This course assumes you have:

- Basic knowledge of Go programming
- Completed the "Quick Start with Golang" course or equivalent
- Understanding of functions and error handling in Go

## Course Structure

This course consists of 5 hands-on labs that will guide you through building increasingly complex concurrent applications. Each lab includes practical examples and exercises to help you master concurrent programming in Go.

Let's start building fast, concurrent programs with Go!
