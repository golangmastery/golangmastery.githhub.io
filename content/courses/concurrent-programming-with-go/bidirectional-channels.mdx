# Bidirectional Channels

By default, channels in Go are bidirectional, which means they can be used to both send and receive values. This is the simplest form of a channel and is what you get when you create a channel without any direction-specific notation.

## Creating a Bidirectional Channel

Creating a bidirectional channel is straightforward:

```go
// Create a bidirectional channel for string values
messages := make(chan string)
```

## Using a Bidirectional Channel

Let's look at a simple example that demonstrates sending and receiving on a bidirectional channel:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    messages := make(chan string)
    
    // Send a value into the channel in a separate goroutine
    go func() { 
        messages <- "ping" 
    }()

    // Receive the value from the channel
    msg := <-messages
    fmt.Println(msg)
}
```

In this example:
1. We create a bidirectional channel called `messages`
2. We launch a goroutine that sends the string "ping" into the channel
3. The main goroutine receives the value from the channel
4. The received value is printed

## Benefits and Limitations

**Benefits:**
- Simple to use and understand
- Flexible - can be used for both sending and receiving
- No need to specify direction when creating the channel

**Limitations:**
- Anyone can read and write to the channel
- This can cause problems in concurrent environments where you want to restrict operations
- No type safety to prevent incorrect usage

## When to Use Bidirectional Channels

Bidirectional channels are most appropriate when:

1. You have a simple communication pattern
2. The same goroutine might need to both send and receive
3. You're prototyping and don't need strict access control

## Common Patterns with Bidirectional Channels

### Ping-Pong Pattern

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func ping(ch chan string) {
    ch <- "ping"
}

func pong(ch chan string) {
    msg := <-ch
    fmt.Println(msg)
    ch <- "pong"
}

func main() {
    ch := make(chan string)
    
    go ping(ch)
    go pong(ch)
    
    fmt.Println(<-ch)
    time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond) // Ensure the goroutines have time to execute
}
```

### Basic Worker Pattern

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func worker(jobs chan int, results chan int) {
    for job := range jobs {
        results <- job * 2 // Double the job value
    }
}

func main() {
    jobs := make(chan int, 5)
    results := make(chan int, 5)
    
    // Start a worker
    go worker(jobs, results)
    
    // Send jobs
    for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
        jobs <- i
    }
    close(jobs)
    
    // Collect results
    for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
        fmt.Println(<-results)
    }
}
```

## Summary

- Bidirectional channels can be used for both sending and receiving
- They're created with `make(chan Type)`
- They're the default channel type in Go
- They offer flexibility but less type safety than directional channels
- They're great for simple communication patterns

In the next lab, we'll look at directional channels, which add type safety by restricting operations to either sending or receiving.
