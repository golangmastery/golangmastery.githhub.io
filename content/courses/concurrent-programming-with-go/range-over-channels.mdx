# Range over Channels

The `range` keyword in Go provides a convenient way to iterate over values received from a channel. It automatically handles waiting for new values and will exit when the channel is closed.

## Basic Range over Channel

Here's the basic syntax for using range with channels:

```go
for value := range ch {
    // Process value
}
```

When using `range` on a channel:
- It iterates over each value received from the channel
- The loop automatically breaks when the channel is closed
- Unlike a normal receive operation (`value, ok := <-ch`), range doesn't return the second boolean value that indicates whether the channel is closed

## Simple Example

Let's look at a simple example of using range with channels:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    ch := make(chan int)
    
    // Start a goroutine that sends values
    go func() {
        for i := 0; i < 6; i++ {
            // Send iterator to channel
            ch <- i
        }
        // Close the channel when done
        close(ch)
    }()
    
    // Range over the channel to receive values
    for v := range ch {
        fmt.Println(v)
    }
}
```

When you run this program, you'll see:

```
0
1
2
3
4
5
```

In this example:
1. We create a channel `ch`
2. We start a goroutine that sends values 0 through 5 to the channel and then closes it
3. We use `range` to receive values from the channel
4. The `range` loop automatically exits when the channel is closed

## Range vs. Manual Receive

Let's compare using `range` with manual receive operations:

```go
// Using range (cleaner, more idiomatic)
for v := range ch {
    fmt.Println(v)
}

// Using manual receive (more verbose)
for {
    v, ok := <-ch
    if !ok {
        // Channel is closed
        break
    }
    fmt.Println(v)
}
```

As you can see, using `range` is more concise and less error-prone.

## Handling Channel Closure

When using `range`, you don't need to explicitly check if the channel is closed. The loop will automatically exit when the channel is closed.

This makes `range` particularly useful in consumer code, where you often want to process all values until the producer indicates it's done by closing the channel.

## Example: Worker Pool with Range

Here's an example of a worker pool that uses `range` to process jobs:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
    "time"
)

func worker(id int, jobs <-chan int, results chan<- int, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
    defer wg.Done()
    
    // Use range to process jobs until the channel is closed
    for job := range jobs {
        fmt.Printf("Worker %d processing job %d\n", id, job)
        time.Sleep(time.Second) // Simulate work
        results <- job * 2
    }
    
    fmt.Printf("Worker %d done\n", id)
}

func main() {
    jobs := make(chan int, 5)
    results := make(chan int, 5)
    
    // Create a wait group to wait for all workers to finish
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    
    // Start 3 workers
    for w := 1; w <= 3; w++ {
        wg.Add(1)
        go worker(w, jobs, results, &wg)
    }
    
    // Send 5 jobs
    for j := 1; j <= 5; j++ {
        jobs <- j
    }
    
    // Close the jobs channel to signal no more jobs
    close(jobs)
    
    // Start a goroutine to close the results channel when all workers are done
    go func() {
        wg.Wait()
        close(results)
    }()
    
    // Use range to collect all results
    for result := range results {
        fmt.Printf("Result: %d\n", result)
    }
}
```

In this example:
1. We use `range` in the worker function to process jobs until the jobs channel is closed
2. We close the jobs channel to signal to the workers that there are no more jobs
3. We use `range` in the main function to collect all results until the results channel is closed
4. We close the results channel when all workers are done

## Using Range with Select

When using `range` with `select`, you need a different approach since `range` is a loop and `select` is a block. Here's a pattern that combines both:

```go
func processMessages(messages <-chan string, quit <-chan bool) {
    for {
        select {
        case msg, ok := <-messages:
            if !ok {
                // messages channel is closed
                return
            }
            fmt.Println("Received:", msg)
        case <-quit:
            fmt.Println("Quitting")
            return
        }
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Close Channels from the Sender

When using `range`, it's important to remember that the sender should close the channel when there are no more values to send. The closer of a channel should be the only goroutine that knows when the channel should be closed.

```go
// Good: Sender closes the channel
go func() {
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        ch <- i
    }
    close(ch)
}()

// Bad: Receiver closes the channel
go func() {
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        ch <- i
    }
}()
// ...
close(ch) // Dangerous! The sender might still be trying to send
```

### 2. Use Done Channels for Signaling Completion

When you need bidirectional communication or complex coordination, consider using done channels:

```go
func worker(jobs <-chan Job, done chan<- bool) {
    for job := range jobs {
        process(job)
    }
    done <- true
}
```

### 3. Use WaitGroups for Multiple Workers

When you have multiple workers, use a WaitGroup to wait for all of them to finish:

```go
func main() {
    jobs := make(chan Job)
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    
    // Start workers
    for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
        wg.Add(1)
        go func() {
            defer wg.Done()
            for job := range jobs {
                process(job)
            }
        }()
    }
    
    // Send jobs
    // ...
    
    // Close the jobs channel
    close(jobs)
    
    // Wait for all workers to finish
    wg.Wait()
}
```

## Summary

- The `range` keyword provides an easy way to iterate over values from a channel
- It automatically handles waiting for values and detecting channel closure
- It's more concise and less error-prone than manual receives
- Always close channels from the sender, not the receiver
- Combine `range` with WaitGroups for coordinating multiple workers
