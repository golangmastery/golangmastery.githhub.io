# Buffered Channels

By default, channels in Go are unbuffered, meaning they will only accept sends (`chan <-`) if there is a corresponding receiver (`<-chan`) ready to receive the value. Buffered channels, on the other hand, can hold a limited number of values without a corresponding receiver.

## Creating a Buffered Channel

To create a buffered channel, you specify the buffer size as the second argument to `make`:

```go
// Create a buffered channel with capacity of 2
messages := make(chan string, 2)
```

## How Buffered Channels Work

Buffered channels work like queues:

1. When you send a value, it's added to the end of the queue
2. When you receive a value, it's taken from the front of the queue
3. If the queue is full, sends will block
4. If the queue is empty, receives will block

## Example of a Buffered Channel

Here's a simple example demonstrating buffered channels:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Create a buffered channel with a capacity of 2
    messages := make(chan string, 2)
    
    // Send two values into the channel without a receiver
    messages <- "buffered"
    messages <- "channel"
    
    // Receive the two values
    fmt.Println(<-messages)  // Output: buffered
    fmt.Println(<-messages)  // Output: channel
}
```

Notice how in this example:
- We can send two values into the channel without any goroutine ready to receive
- The sends don't block because the buffer isn't full yet
- If we tried to send a third value without first receiving any, the send would block

## When to Use Buffered Channels

Buffered channels are useful in several scenarios:

1. **Reducing goroutine blocking**: When the sender doesn't need to wait for the receiver to be ready
2. **Bursty workloads**: When the rate of sends and receives varies over time
3. **Batching operations**: When you want to process items in batches rather than one at a time
4. **Producer/consumer patterns**: When producers might temporarily produce faster than consumers can consume

## Choosing a Buffer Size

Selecting an appropriate buffer size depends on your specific use case:

- **Too small**: May cause unnecessary blocking and reduce concurrency
- **Too large**: May hide synchronization bugs and consume too much memory
- **Just right**: Provides enough capacity to smooth out temporary rate differences

As a general rule, use the smallest buffer size that prevents unnecessary blocking.

## Example: Worker Pool with Buffered Channels

Here's a more practical example using buffered channels to implement a worker pool:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func worker(id int, jobs <-chan int, results chan<- int) {
    for job := range jobs {
        fmt.Printf("Worker %d processing job %d\n", id, job)
        time.Sleep(time.Second) // Simulate work
        results <- job * 2
    }
}

func main() {
    // Create buffered channels
    jobs := make(chan int, 100)
    results := make(chan int, 100)
    
    // Start workers
    for w := 1; w <= 3; w++ {
        go worker(w, jobs, results)
    }
    
    // Send jobs
    for j := 1; j <= 9; j++ {
        jobs <- j
    }
    close(jobs)
    
    // Collect results
    for a := 1; a <= 9; a++ {
        <-results
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The buffered `jobs` channel allows us to queue up jobs without waiting for workers
- The buffered `results` channel allows workers to report results without waiting for the main goroutine

## Channel Blocking Behavior with Buffers

Understanding when buffered channels block is crucial:

1. **Send operation** (`ch <- value`):
   - Blocks when the buffer is full
   - Doesn't block when the buffer has space

2. **Receive operation** (`<-ch`):
   - Blocks when the buffer is empty
   - Doesn't block when the buffer has at least one value

## Deadlocks with Buffered Channels

Even with buffered channels, deadlocks can still occur. Common causes include:

- Buffer too small for the number of sends
- Forgetting to close channels
- Circular dependencies between goroutines

## Performance Considerations

Some performance characteristics to keep in mind:

- Unbuffered channels are slightly faster than buffered channels for synchronization
- Larger buffer sizes don't necessarily mean better performance
- The optimal buffer size depends on your specific workload patterns

## Summary

- Buffered channels have a capacity that allows them to hold multiple values
- They're created with `make(chan Type, capacity)`
- Sends only block when the buffer is full
- Receives only block when the buffer is empty
- They're useful for decoupling senders and receivers
- Choose buffer sizes carefully based on your specific use case
