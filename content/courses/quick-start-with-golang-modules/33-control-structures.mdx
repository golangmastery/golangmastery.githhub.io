# Control Structures in Go

Control structures direct the flow of your program's execution. Go provides simple, clean control structures to handle conditionals, loops, and switching between different execution paths.

## Conditional Statements

### If Statement

The basic if statement in Go looks like this:

```go
if condition {
    // code to execute if condition is true
}
```

Notice that Go doesn't require parentheses around the condition, but the braces `{}` are mandatory.

### If-Else Statement

You can add an else clause to handle the case when the condition is false:

```go
if condition {
    // code to execute if condition is true
} else {
    // code to execute if condition is false
}
```

### If with Multiple Conditions

For multiple conditions, use else if:

```go
if condition1 {
    // code for condition1
} else if condition2 {
    // code for condition2
} else {
    // code for all other cases
}
```

### If with a Short Statement

Go allows you to execute a short statement before the condition:

```go
if x := getValue(); x > 10 {
    fmt.Println("x is greater than 10")
} else {
    fmt.Println("x is less than or equal to 10")
}
```

In this example, `x` is scoped to the if and else blocks only.

## Loops

Go has only one looping construct: the `for` loop. However, it's versatile and can be used in several ways.

### Standard For Loop

The standard for loop has three components: init statement, condition, and post statement:

```go
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    fmt.Println(i)
}
```

### For Loop as a While Loop

If you skip the init and post statements, you get a while-like loop:

```go
count := 0
for count < 5 {
    fmt.Println(count)
    count++
}
```

### Infinite Loop

An infinite loop is created by omitting the condition:

```go
for {
    fmt.Println("Forever!")
    // Need a break statement or return to exit
    break
}
```

### For Loop with Range

The `range` form of the for loop iterates over elements in collections like arrays, slices, strings, maps, and channels:

```go
// Iterating over a slice
numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
for index, value := range numbers {
    fmt.Printf("Index: %d, Value: %d\n", index, value)
}

// Iterating over a map
colors := map[string]string{"red": "#ff0000", "green": "#00ff00"}
for key, value := range colors {
    fmt.Printf("Key: %s, Value: %s\n", key, value)
}
```

### Break and Continue

Use `break` to exit a loop and `continue` to skip to the next iteration:

```go
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    if i == 3 {
        continue // Skip the rest of this iteration
    }
    if i == 8 {
        break // Exit the loop completely
    }
    fmt.Println(i)
}
```

## Switch Statement

The switch statement provides a cleaner way to write multiple if-else statements:

```go
switch day {
case "Monday":
    fmt.Println("Start of work week")
case "Friday":
    fmt.Println("End of work week")
case "Saturday", "Sunday": // Multiple cases
    fmt.Println("Weekend!")
default:
    fmt.Println("Midweek")
}
```

### Switch with No Expression

A switch without an expression is equivalent to `switch true`:

```go
switch {
case time.Hour < 12:
    fmt.Println("Good morning!")
case time.Hour < 17:
    fmt.Println("Good afternoon!")
default:
    fmt.Println("Good evening!")
}
```

### Fallthrough

In Go, each case breaks automatically. To execute the next case, use the `fallthrough` keyword:

```go
switch num := 1; num {
case 1:
    fmt.Println("One")
    fallthrough
case 2:
    fmt.Println("Less than three")
case 3:
    fmt.Println("Three or less")
}
```

This will print "One" and "Less than three".

## Example: Combining Control Structures

Here's a complete example combining different control structures:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Using a for loop with an if statement
    for i := 1; i <= 20; i++ {
        if i%2 == 0 {
            fmt.Printf("%d is even\n", i)
        } else {
            fmt.Printf("%d is odd\n", i)
        }
        
        // Using a switch statement
        switch {
        case i%3 == 0 && i%5 == 0:
            fmt.Println("  FizzBuzz")
        case i%3 == 0:
            fmt.Println("  Fizz")
        case i%5 == 0:
            fmt.Println("  Buzz")
        }
    }
}
```

## Exercise

1. Write a program that uses if statements to categorize numbers as positive, negative, or zero
2. Create a loop that prints only the even numbers from 1 to 20
3. Implement a simple FizzBuzz program using a switch statement

In the next module, we'll explore functions in Go.
