# Hello World in Go

Let's start with the traditional "Hello World" program. This simple program will help you understand the basic structure of a Go application.

## Your First Go Program

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello World")
}
```

Let's break down this program:

- `package main`: Every Go file starts with a package declaration. The `main` package is special - it defines an executable program rather than a library.
- `import "fmt"`: This imports the format package from the standard library, which provides formatting functions.
- `func main()`: The entry point of the program. Execution begins in the `main` function.
- `fmt.Println("Hello World")`: This prints the text "Hello World" to the console.

## Running Your First Program

To run this program, save it as `hello.go` and execute the following command:

```bash
go run hello.go
```

You should see `Hello World` printed to your console.

## Building an Executable

You can also compile your program into a standalone executable:

```bash
go build hello.go
```

This will create an executable file named `hello` (or `hello.exe` on Windows). You can run this executable directly:

```bash
./hello
```

## Understanding Go Program Structure

Every Go program follows a similar structure:

1. **Package Declaration**: All Go files begin with `package <name>`. Executable programs use `package main`.
2. **Import Statements**: Import other packages that your code needs.
3. **Functions and Variables**: Declare functions and variables. The `main()` function is required for executable programs.
4. **Code Comments**: Add documentation to your code using `//` for single-line comments or `/* */` for multi-line comments.

## Exercise

Try modifying the "Hello World" program to:

1. Print your name instead of "Hello World"
2. Print multiple lines using multiple `fmt.Println()` calls
3. Add comments to explain what the program does

In the next module, we'll explore Go's variables and data types.
