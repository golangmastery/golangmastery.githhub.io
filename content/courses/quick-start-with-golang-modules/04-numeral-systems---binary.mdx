## Numeral Systems - Binary

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Printf("%d - %b \n", 42, 42)
}
```

[Run](https://play.golang.org/p/8oA-JOz0flp)

Output:
```
42 - 101010 
Program exited.
```

In the above program, the annotation verb `%b` formats a number in binary (which represents 101010, base 2 format) and the annotation verb `%d` formats a number in Base 10 (which represents 42, base 10 format).

### Integer cheatsheet for fmt 

```
%b    base 2
%c    the character represented by the corresponding Unicode code point
%d    base 10
%o    base 8
%q    a single-quoted character literal safely escaped with Go syntax
%x    base 16, with lower-case letters for a-f
%X    base 16, with upper-case letters for A-F
%U    Unicode format: U+1234; same as "U+%04X"
```
