# Variables and Data Types in Go

Go is a statically typed language, which means variable types are checked at compile time. In this module, we'll explore Go's type system and how to work with variables.

## Basic Types in Go

Go has several built-in types:

- **Numeric types**: 
  - Integers: `int`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `uint`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`
  - Floating point: `float32`, `float64`
  - Complex: `complex64`, `complex128`
- **Boolean type**: `bool` (values: `true` and `false`)
- **String type**: `string` (UTF-8 encoded text)
- **Error type**: `error`

## Variable Declaration

There are several ways to declare variables in Go:

### Method 1: Explicit Type

```go
var name string = "Gopher"
var age int = 25
var isActive bool = true
```

### Method 2: Type Inference

Go can infer the type from the value:

```go
var name = "Gopher"  // string type is inferred
var age = 25         // int type is inferred
var isActive = true  // bool type is inferred
```

### Method 3: Short Variable Declaration

Inside functions, you can use the short declaration operator (`:=`):

```go
name := "Gopher"
age := 25
isActive := true
```

This is the most common form used inside functions.

## Multiple Variable Declaration

You can declare multiple variables at once:

```go
var x, y, z int = 10, 20, 30

// Or with type inference
var a, b, c = "hello", 50, true

// Or with short declaration
firstName, lastName, age := "Go", "pher", 25
```

## Zero Values

Variables declared without an explicit initial value are given their zero value:

```go
var i int       // Zero value: 0
var f float64   // Zero value: 0.0
var b bool      // Zero value: false
var s string    // Zero value: "" (empty string)
```

## Constants

Constants are declared using the `const` keyword:

```go
const Pi = 3.14159
const (
    StatusOK = 200
    StatusNotFound = 404
)
```

Constants can be character, string, boolean, or numeric values.

## Type Conversion

Go doesn't automatically convert between types. You must explicitly convert:

```go
var i int = 42
var f float64 = float64(i)
var u uint = uint(f)
```

## Example: Working with Different Types

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Different ways to declare variables
    var a int = 10
    var b = 20
    c := 30
    
    // Zero values
    var d int
    var e string
    var f bool
    
    // Constants
    const Pi = 3.14
    
    fmt.Println("a:", a)
    fmt.Println("b:", b)
    fmt.Println("c:", c)
    fmt.Println("d (zero value):", d)
    fmt.Println("e (zero value):", e)
    fmt.Println("f (zero value):", f)
    fmt.Println("Pi:", Pi)
}
```

## Type Checking in Action

Go's type system helps catch errors at compile time:

```go
x := 10
y := "hello"
z := x + y  // This will cause a compile-time error
```

The above code won't compile because Go doesn't allow adding an integer and a string.

## Exercise

1. Create a program that declares variables of different types
2. Try converting between different types
3. Experiment with zero values and constants

In the next module, we'll look at control structures in Go (if statements, loops, and switches).
