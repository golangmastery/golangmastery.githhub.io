# Unbuffered Channels

Unbuffered channels are the default type of channel in Go. They provide synchronous communication between goroutines, meaning that a send operation will block until there's a corresponding receive operation ready to receive the value, and vice versa.

## Creating an Unbuffered Channel

To create an unbuffered channel, we use the `make` function without specifying a buffer size:

```go
// Create an unbuffered channel of integers
ch := make(chan int)
```

## Understanding Synchronization

The key characteristic of unbuffered channels is that they synchronize the sender and receiver:

1. A send operation `ch <- value` blocks until another goroutine is ready to receive from the channel
2. A receive operation `value := <-ch` blocks until another goroutine sends a value to the channel

This means that the sender and receiver must "meet" in time for the communication to take place.

## Visual Representation

Here's a visual representation of how unbuffered channels work:

```
Sender                   Receiver
  |                        |
  | --- send value ------> | (blocks until receiver is ready)
  |                        |
  | <--- acknowledged <--- |
  |                        |
```

## Basic Example

Let's look at a simple example of using an unbuffered channel:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    // Create an unbuffered channel
    ch := make(chan string)
    
    // Start a goroutine that sends a message
    go func() {
        fmt.Println("Sending message...")
        ch <- "Hello!"  // This will block until the main goroutine receives
        fmt.Println("Message sent!")
    }()
    
    // Wait a moment to demonstrate the blocking behavior
    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
    
    // Receive the message
    fmt.Println("About to receive...")
    msg := <-ch  // This unblocks the sending goroutine
    fmt.Println("Received:", msg)
    
    // Allow time to see the "Message sent!" output
    time.Sleep(time.Millisecond)
}
```

When you run this program, you'll see:

```
Sending message...
About to receive...
Received: Hello!
Message sent!
```

Notice the sequence of events:
1. The goroutine starts and prints "Sending message..."
2. It tries to send "Hello!" but blocks because no one is receiving yet
3. After 2 seconds, the main goroutine prints "About to receive..."
4. It receives the message, allowing the goroutine to continue
5. The goroutine prints "Message sent!" and exits

## Multiple Senders and Receivers

Unbuffered channels work well with multiple senders and receivers:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
    "time"
)

func sender(id int, ch chan<- string, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
    defer wg.Done()
    
    msg := fmt.Sprintf("Message from sender %d", id)
    fmt.Printf("Sender %d: sending message\n", id)
    ch <- msg  // Will block until a receiver is ready
    fmt.Printf("Sender %d: message sent\n", id)
}

func receiver(id int, ch <-chan string, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
    defer wg.Done()
    
    // Simulate different readiness times
    time.Sleep(time.Duration(id) * 100 * time.Millisecond)
    
    fmt.Printf("Receiver %d: waiting for message\n", id)
    msg := <-ch  // Will block until a sender is ready
    fmt.Printf("Receiver %d: got message: %s\n", id, msg)
}

func main() {
    ch := make(chan string)  // Unbuffered channel
    
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    
    // Start 3 senders
    for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
        wg.Add(1)
        go sender(i, ch, &wg)
    }
    
    // Start 3 receivers
    for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
        wg.Add(1)
        go receiver(i, ch, &wg)
    }
    
    // Wait for all goroutines to finish
    wg.Wait()
}
```

In this example, senders and receivers pair up one-to-one. The order of pairing depends on scheduling and timing.

## Use Cases for Unbuffered Channels

Unbuffered channels are ideal for:

1. **Synchronization**: When you need to synchronize the execution of goroutines
2. **Guaranteed delivery**: When you need to ensure that a message is received
3. **Signal events**: When you want to signal that an event has occurred
4. **Turn-taking**: When goroutines need to take turns performing operations

## Signaling with Unbuffered Channels

A common pattern is to use unbuffered channels for signaling, often with empty structs to minimize memory usage:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func worker(done chan struct{}) {
    fmt.Println("Working...")
    time.Sleep(time.Second)
    fmt.Println("Done working!")
    
    // Signal that we're done
    done <- struct{}{}
}

func main() {
    done := make(chan struct{})
    
    go worker(done)
    
    // Wait for the worker to signal completion
    <-done
    
    fmt.Println("Main: received completion signal")
}
```

## Deadlocks with Unbuffered Channels

A common mistake with unbuffered channels is creating situations that lead to deadlocks:

```go
package main

func main() {
    ch := make(chan int)
    
    // This will deadlock because there's no receiver
    ch <- 1
    
    // Code here will never execute
    <-ch
}
```

If you run this, you'll get:

```
fatal error: all goroutines are asleep - deadlock!
```

To fix this, you need to ensure that sends and receives happen in separate goroutines:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    ch := make(chan int)
    
    // Send in a separate goroutine
    go func() {
        ch <- 1
    }()
    
    // Now we can receive
    value := <-ch
    fmt.Println(value)
}
```

## Nil Channels

It's important to note that a nil channel (the zero value of a channel variable) will block forever on both send and receive operations:

```go
var ch chan int  // nil channel
<-ch  // blocks forever
ch <- 1  // blocks forever
```

This behavior can be useful in select statements to disable specific cases.

## Channel Closing

When you close an unbuffered channel, any blocked senders will panic, but blocked receivers will get the zero value of the channel's type with an `ok` value of `false`:

```go
ch := make(chan int)
close(ch)

// This will return 0, false
value, ok := <-ch

// This will range over 0 values and exit immediately
for v := range ch {
    // Never executed
}
```

## Performance Considerations

Unbuffered channels are generally very fast, but there's a performance cost to the context switching and synchronization. If performance is critical and you don't need the synchronization guarantees, buffered channels might be more appropriate.

## Summary

- Unbuffered channels provide synchronous communication between goroutines
- They block until both sender and receiver are ready
- They're useful for synchronization and guaranteed delivery
- Be careful about potential deadlocks
- Nil channels block forever
- Closing channels unblocks receivers but causes senders to panic

Unbuffered channels are one of the most powerful synchronization tools in Go. Understanding their behavior is essential for writing correct and efficient concurrent programs.

In the next lab, we'll compare unbuffered and buffered channels to understand when to use each type.
