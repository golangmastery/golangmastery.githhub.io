# Race Conditions

A race condition occurs when two or more goroutines access shared data concurrently, and at least one of the accesses is a write. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and hard-to-debug issues.

## Understanding Race Conditions

Race conditions happen when the outcome of a program depends on the timing or order of execution of multiple goroutines. If the accesses to shared data aren't properly synchronized, the program may behave incorrectly or produce different results on different runs.

## A Simple Example of a Race Condition

Here's a simple program that demonstrates a race condition:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
)

var msg string
var wg sync.WaitGroup

func updateMessage(s string) {
    defer wg.Done()
    msg = s
}

func main() {
    msg = "Hello, world!"
    
    wg.Add(2)
    go updateMessage("Hello, one")
    go updateMessage("Hello, two")
    wg.Wait()
    
    fmt.Println(msg)
}
```

In this program:
1. We have a global variable `msg`
2. We launch two goroutines that both modify `msg`
3. The final value of `msg` depends on which goroutine executes last
4. The output could be either "Hello, one" or "Hello, two"

## Detecting Race Conditions

Go includes a built-in race detector that can help identify race conditions in your code. To use it, run your program with the `-race` flag:

```bash
go run -race .
```

If we run our example with the race detector:

```bash
go run -race .
==================
WARNING: DATA RACE
Write at 0x0000011d09b0 by goroutine 8:
  main.updateMessage()
      /path/to/file.go:13 +0x78
  main.main路dwrap路3()
      /path/to/file.go:22 +0x47

Previous write at 0x0000011d09b0 by goroutine 7:
  main.updateMessage()
      /path/to/file.go:13 +0x78
  main.main路dwrap路2()
      /path/to/file.go:21 +0x47

Goroutine 8 (running) created at:
  main.main()
      /path/to/file.go:22 +0x164

Goroutine 7 (finished) created at:
  main.main()
      /path/to/file.go:21 +0xeb
==================
Hello, two
Found 1 data race(s)
exit status 66
```

The race detector tells us:
1. There's a race condition on a memory address
2. Two goroutines are writing to the same location
3. The specific lines of code involved in the race

## The Risks of Race Conditions

Race conditions can lead to several problems:

1. **Inconsistent results**: Your program produces different results on each run
2. **Data corruption**: Data structures may be left in an inconsistent state
3. **Memory corruption**: In low-level languages, this can cause crashes
4. **Subtle bugs**: The program works most of the time but fails occasionally

## Testing for Race Conditions

You can also use the race detector when running tests:

```bash
go test -race ./...
```

Here's a test that would detect our race condition:

```go
package main

import (
    "testing"
)

func Test_updateMessage(t *testing.T) {
    msg = "Hello, world!"

    wg.Add(2)
    go updateMessage("Hello, one")
    go updateMessage("Hello, two")
    wg.Wait()

    // The test doesn't actually fail, but the race detector
    // will report the race condition
    if msg != "Hello, one" && msg != "Hello, two" {
        t.Error("Expected message to be updated")
    }
}
```

## Real-World Example

Let's look at a more realistic example involving a shared counter:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
)

func main() {
    // Variable for bank balance
    var bankBalance int
    
    // Print starting balance
    fmt.Printf("Initial account balance: $%d.00\n", bankBalance)
    
    // Define weekly revenue
    incomes := []int{500, 10, 50, 100}
    
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    wg.Add(len(incomes))
    
    // Loop through 52 weeks and add income
    for i, income := range incomes {
        go func(i int, income int) {
            defer wg.Done()
            
            for week := 1; week <= 52; week++ {
                // This is a race condition - multiple goroutines
                // are reading and writing bankBalance without synchronization
                temp := bankBalance
                temp += income
                bankBalance = temp
                
                fmt.Printf("On week %d, you earned $%d.00 from source %d\n", 
                          week, income, i)
            }
        }(i, income)
    }
    
    wg.Wait()
    
    // Print final balance
    fmt.Printf("Final bank balance: $%d.00\n", bankBalance)
}
```

In this example, we have multiple goroutines updating a shared `bankBalance` variable. Because these updates aren't synchronized, the final balance might be incorrect.

## Summary

- Race conditions occur when multiple goroutines access shared data concurrently
- They lead to unpredictable behavior and inconsistent results
- Go's race detector can help identify race conditions
- Race conditions are a common source of bugs in concurrent programs
- Always be cautious when sharing data between goroutines

In the next lab, we'll learn how to use mutexes to protect shared data and prevent race conditions.
