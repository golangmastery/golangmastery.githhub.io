# Directional Channels

In Go, you can specify if a channel is meant to be used only for reading or only for writing data. These are called directional channels, and they increase the type-safety of your program.

## Why Use Directional Channels?

Directional channels offer several advantages:

1. **Type safety**: They prevent accidental reads from write-only channels and accidental writes to read-only channels
2. **Clear intent**: They make the intended use of a channel obvious in function signatures
3. **Better documentation**: They help document how data flows through your program

## Send-Only and Receive-Only Channels

There are two types of directional channels:

1. **Send-only channel** (chan<- T): Can only send values, cannot receive
2. **Receive-only channel** (<-chan T): Can only receive values, cannot send

## Syntax

```go
// Send-only channel (can only send to this channel)
var sendOnly chan<- string

// Receive-only channel (can only receive from this channel)
var receiveOnly <-chan string
```

## Converting Bidirectional Channels to Directional Channels

Any bidirectional channel can be assigned to a directional channel variable, but not vice versa:

```go
ch := make(chan string)  // Bidirectional channel

var sendOnly chan<- string = ch  // Convert to send-only
var receiveOnly <-chan string = ch  // Convert to receive-only
```

## Example: Using Directional Channels

Here's a practical example that demonstrates directional channels:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// ping takes a send-only channel
func ping(pings chan<- string, msg string) {
    pings <- msg
}

// pong takes a receive-only channel and a send-only channel
func pong(pings <-chan string, pongs chan<- string) {
    msg := <-pings
    pongs <- msg
}

func main() {
    pings := make(chan string, 1)
    pongs := make(chan string, 1)
    
    ping(pings, "passed message")
    pong(pings, pongs)
    
    fmt.Println(<-pongs)  // prints: passed message
}
```

In this example:

1. The `ping` function can only send to the `pings` channel
2. The `pong` function can only receive from the `pings` channel and only send to the `pongs` channel
3. This enforces a clear flow of data in one direction

## Benefits in Larger Programs

Directional channels become especially valuable in larger programs:

```go
func process(input <-chan Job, output chan<- Result) {
    for job := range input {
        // Process the job
        result := doWork(job)
        output <- result
    }
}
```

By using directional channels, this function clearly communicates that it:
- Consumes jobs from the input channel
- Produces results to the output channel
- Cannot send to the input channel
- Cannot receive from the output channel

## Closing Directional Channels

One important limitation is that you can only close a channel that you can send to. This means:
- You can close a bidirectional channel
- You can close a send-only channel
- You cannot close a receive-only channel

```go
// Valid - can close a send-only channel
func producer(ch chan<- int) {
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        ch <- i
    }
    close(ch)  // This is valid
}

// Invalid - cannot close a receive-only channel
func consumer(ch <-chan int) {
    for i := range ch {
        fmt.Println(i)
    }
    // close(ch)  // This would be a compilation error
}
```

## Summary

- Directional channels restrict operations to either sending or receiving
- They provide greater type safety and clearer intent
- Send-only channels use the syntax `chan<- Type`
- Receive-only channels use the syntax `<-chan Type`
- Bidirectional channels can be converted to directional channels
- They're especially useful for clearly defining the data flow in functions

In the next lab, we'll explore buffered channels, which can hold multiple values without a receiver being ready.
