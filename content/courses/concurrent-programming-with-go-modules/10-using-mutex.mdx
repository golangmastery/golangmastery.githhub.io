# Using Mutex

In the previous lab, we learned about race conditions that occur when multiple goroutines access shared data concurrently. Now, we'll explore how to use mutexes to protect shared data and prevent these race conditions.

## What is a Mutex?

A mutex (mutual exclusion) is a synchronization primitive that provides a way to ensure that only one goroutine can access a particular resource at a time. The `sync` package in Go provides two types of mutexes:

1. `sync.Mutex`: A basic mutex that can be locked and unlocked
2. `sync.RWMutex`: A reader/writer mutex that allows multiple readers but only one writer

## Using a Basic Mutex

Here's how to use a basic mutex:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
)

var (
    msg     string
    wg      sync.WaitGroup
    mutex   sync.Mutex
)

func updateMessage(s string) {
    defer wg.Done()
    
    // Lock the mutex before accessing shared data
    mutex.Lock()
    msg = s
    // Unlock the mutex when done
    mutex.Unlock()
}

func main() {
    msg = "Hello, world!"
    
    wg.Add(2)
    go updateMessage("Hello, one")
    go updateMessage("Hello, two")
    wg.Wait()
    
    fmt.Println(msg)
}
```

In this updated version:
1. We create a mutex using `sync.Mutex`
2. Before accessing the shared variable `msg`, we call `mutex.Lock()`
3. After we're done with the access, we call `mutex.Unlock()`
4. This ensures that only one goroutine can update `msg` at a time

## Mutex Best Practices

### 1. Always Unlock After Locking

It's essential to ensure that for every call to `Lock()`, there's a corresponding call to `Unlock()`. A common pattern is to use `defer` to guarantee unlocking:

```go
func updateMessage(s string) {
    defer wg.Done()
    
    mutex.Lock()
    defer mutex.Unlock() // This guarantees unlocking even if the function panics
    
    msg = s
}
```

### 2. Keep Lock Sections Small

To maximize concurrency, keep the code between `Lock()` and `Unlock()` as small as possible:

```go
// Good: Lock only what needs protection
mutex.Lock()
sharedVariable += 1
mutex.Unlock()

// Process non-shared data without the lock
localData := process(someData)

// Bad: Locking more than necessary
mutex.Lock()
sharedVariable += 1
localData := process(someData) // This doesn't need the lock
mutex.Unlock()
```

### 3. Be Aware of Deadlocks

Improper use of mutexes can lead to deadlocks. A deadlock occurs when two or more goroutines are waiting for each other to release a resource, resulting in all of them being blocked forever.

## Real-World Example: Bank Balance

Let's fix our bank balance example from the previous lab using a mutex:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
)

func main() {
    // Variable for bank balance
    var bankBalance int
    var balance sync.Mutex
    
    // Print starting balance
    fmt.Printf("Initial account balance: $%d.00\n", bankBalance)
    
    // Define weekly revenue
    incomes := []int{500, 10, 50, 100}
    
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    wg.Add(len(incomes))
    
    // Loop through 52 weeks and add income
    for i, income := range incomes {
        go func(i int, income int) {
            defer wg.Done()
            
            for week := 1; week <= 52; week++ {
                // Lock the mutex before accessing bankBalance
                balance.Lock()
                temp := bankBalance
                temp += income
                bankBalance = temp
                balance.Unlock()
                
                fmt.Printf("On week %d, you earned $%d.00 from source %d\n", 
                          week, income, i)
            }
        }(i, income)
    }
    
    wg.Wait()
    
    // Print final balance
    fmt.Printf("Final bank balance: $%d.00\n", bankBalance)
}
```

In this version:
1. We create a mutex `balance` to protect access to `bankBalance`
2. We lock the mutex before reading or writing `bankBalance`
3. We unlock the mutex after we're done with the access
4. This ensures that only one goroutine can update `bankBalance` at a time

## Testing the Fixed Code

We can verify that our mutex-protected code doesn't have race conditions by running it with the race detector:

```bash
go run -race .
```

No race conditions should be reported, confirming that our code is now safe for concurrent execution.

## Reader/Writer Mutex (RWMutex)

For scenarios where you have many readers and few writers, the `sync.RWMutex` can provide better performance:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
    "time"
)

type BankAccount struct {
    balance int
    mutex   sync.RWMutex
}

func (b *BankAccount) Balance() int {
    b.mutex.RLock() // Multiple readers can hold the read lock
    defer b.mutex.RUnlock()
    return b.balance
}

func (b *BankAccount) Deposit(amount int) {
    b.mutex.Lock() // Only one writer can hold the write lock
    defer b.mutex.Unlock()
    b.balance += amount
}

func main() {
    account := &BankAccount{}
    
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    
    // Launch 5 writers (deposits)
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        wg.Add(1)
        go func(amount int) {
            defer wg.Done()
            account.Deposit(amount)
        }(i * 100)
    }
    
    // Launch 10 readers (balance checks)
    for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
        wg.Add(1)
        go func() {
            defer wg.Done()
            balance := account.Balance()
            fmt.Printf("Balance: $%d.00\n", balance)
        }()
    }
    
    wg.Wait()
    fmt.Printf("Final balance: $%d.00\n", account.Balance())
}
```

In this example:
1. We use `RLock()` and `RUnlock()` for read-only operations
2. We use `Lock()` and `Unlock()` for write operations
3. Multiple goroutines can read the balance simultaneously
4. Only one goroutine can deposit at a time, and no reads can happen during a deposit

## Common Mistakes with Mutexes

### 1. Forgetting to Unlock

Forgetting to unlock a mutex after locking it will cause any other goroutine that tries to acquire the lock to block indefinitely.

### 2. Copying a Mutex

Mutexes should not be copied after their first use. Always use pointers to pass mutexes around:

```go
// Good: Pass mutex by pointer
func process(m *sync.Mutex) {
    m.Lock()
    defer m.Unlock()
    // Process data
}

// Bad: Copy mutex (will not work correctly)
func process(m sync.Mutex) {
    m.Lock()
    defer m.Unlock()
    // Process data
}
```

### 3. Holding a Lock Too Long

Holding a lock for longer than necessary reduces concurrency:

```go
// Bad: Lock held during I/O
mutex.Lock()
result := complexCalculation() // CPU-bound, OK
fmt.Println(result)           // I/O, don't hold lock
mutex.Unlock()

// Good: Release lock before I/O
mutex.Lock()
result := complexCalculation()
mutex.Unlock()
fmt.Println(result)
```

## Summary

- Mutexes provide a way to ensure exclusive access to shared resources
- Use `mutex.Lock()` and `mutex.Unlock()` to protect critical sections
- Always unlock a mutex after locking it, ideally using `defer`
- Keep the locked section as small as possible for better concurrency
- Use `sync.RWMutex` when you have many more reads than writes
- Be careful to avoid deadlocks, copied mutexes, and long lock durations

Using mutexes is one way to handle shared data in concurrent programs. In the next lab, we'll explore the Producer-Consumer pattern, a common concurrent programming pattern that uses channels for communication between goroutines.
