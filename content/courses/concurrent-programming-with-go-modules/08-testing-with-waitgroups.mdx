# Testing with WaitGroups

Writing tests for concurrent code can be challenging because of the non-deterministic nature of concurrent execution. WaitGroups are essential for reliably testing goroutines and ensuring all concurrent operations complete before making assertions.

## Why Testing Concurrent Code is Challenging

Concurrent code introduces several testing challenges:

1. **Non-determinism**: Goroutines may execute in different orders each time
2. **Race conditions**: Shared resources might be accessed simultaneously
3. **Timing issues**: Tests may pass or fail based on execution timing
4. **Deadlocks**: Tests might hang if goroutines don't complete

WaitGroups help address these challenges by providing a way to ensure all goroutines complete before making assertions.

## Basic Pattern for Testing with WaitGroups

Here's a general pattern for testing concurrent code with WaitGroups:

1. Create a WaitGroup
2. Set up the test case and expected results
3. Launch goroutines and add them to the WaitGroup
4. Wait for all goroutines to complete
5. Make assertions on the results

## Testing a Simple Concurrent Function

Let's test a simple function that prints a message using a goroutine:

```go
package main

import (
    "io"
    "os"
    "strings"
    "sync"
    "testing"
)

func printSomething(s string, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
    defer wg.Done()
    fmt.Println(s)
}

func Test_printSomething(t *testing.T) {
    // Capture stdout
    stdOut := os.Stdout
    r, w, _ := os.Pipe()
    os.Stdout = w

    // Create a WaitGroup and run the function
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    wg.Add(1)
    go printSomething("ok print", &wg)
    wg.Wait()

    // Restore stdout and read the output
    w.Close()
    result, _ := io.ReadAll(r)
    output := string(result)
    os.Stdout = stdOut

    // Make assertions
    if !strings.Contains(output, "ok print") {
        t.Errorf("Expected output to contain 'ok print' but got %s", output)
    }
}
```

In this test:
1. We capture standard output to be able to test what was printed
2. We create a WaitGroup and run our function in a goroutine
3. We wait for the goroutine to complete
4. We restore standard output and check the captured output

## Testing Message Updates

Let's test a concurrent function that updates a shared message:

```go
package main

import (
    "sync"
    "testing"
)

var msg string

func updateMessage(s string, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
    defer wg.Done()
    msg = s
}

func Test_updateMessage(t *testing.T) {
    // Set initial message
    msg = "Hello, world!"

    // Create a WaitGroup and run the function
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    wg.Add(1)
    go updateMessage("Hello, one", &wg)
    wg.Wait()

    // Check the result
    if msg != "Hello, one" {
        t.Errorf("Expected message to be 'Hello, one' but got '%s'", msg)
    }
}
```

## Testing with Multiple Goroutines

When testing functions that launch multiple goroutines, make sure to set the WaitGroup counter correctly:

```go
func processItems(items []string) []string {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    results := make([]string, len(items))
    
    for i, item := range items {
        wg.Add(1)
        go func(i int, item string) {
            defer wg.Done()
            results[i] = "Processed: " + item
        }(i, item)
    }
    
    wg.Wait()
    return results
}

func Test_processItems(t *testing.T) {
    items := []string{"one", "two", "three"}
    
    results := processItems(items)
    
    // Make assertions
    expected := []string{
        "Processed: one",
        "Processed: two",
        "Processed: three",
    }
    
    for i, exp := range expected {
        if results[i] != exp {
            t.Errorf("Expected %s but got %s at position %d", exp, results[i], i)
        }
    }
}
```

## Testing for Race Conditions

Go provides a race detector that can help identify race conditions in your tests. Run your tests with the `-race` flag:

```
go test -race ./...
```

Here's an example of a test that would catch a race condition:

```go
func Test_concurrentAccess(t *testing.T) {
    counter := 0
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    
    // Launch 100 goroutines that all increment counter
    for i := 0; i < 100; i++ {
        wg.Add(1)
        go func() {
            defer wg.Done()
            counter++ // Race condition: multiple goroutines access counter simultaneously
        }()
    }
    
    wg.Wait()
    
    if counter != 100 {
        t.Errorf("Expected counter to be 100, but got %d", counter)
    }
}
```

When run with `-race`, this test will detect the race condition on `counter`.

## Testing Timeout to Prevent Hangs

To prevent tests from hanging, you can use the testing package's built-in timeout mechanisms:

```go
func Test_possiblyHangingFunction(t *testing.T) {
    // Set a timeout of 5 seconds for this test
    t.Parallel()
    
    done := make(chan bool)
    
    go func() {
        // Run the test
        var wg sync.WaitGroup
        wg.Add(1)
        go func() {
            defer wg.Done()
            // Potentially long operation
        }()
        wg.Wait()
        
        done <- true
    }()
    
    select {
    case <-done:
        // Test completed in time
    case <-time.After(5 * time.Second):
        t.Fatal("Test timed out after 5 seconds")
    }
}
```

## Best Practices for Testing with WaitGroups

1. **Always Wait**: Always call `wg.Wait()` before making assertions
2. **Test for Race Conditions**: Use the `-race` flag to detect race conditions
3. **Set Timeouts**: Prevent tests from hanging with appropriate timeouts
4. **Capture Output**: Redirect output when testing functions that print
5. **Use Deterministic Input**: When possible, use input that produces deterministic results
6. **Test Edge Cases**: Test with zero goroutines, many goroutines, etc.
7. **Run Tests Multiple Times**: Run tests multiple times to catch timing-dependent issues
