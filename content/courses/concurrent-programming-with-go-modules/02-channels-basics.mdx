# Channels Basics

Channels are one of the core features of Go's concurrency model. They provide a way for goroutines to communicate with each other and synchronize their execution.

## What are Channels?

Channels can be imagined as a pipe for streams of data. They are used to communicate information between goroutines. The fundamental philosophy in Go is:

> Don't communicate by sharing memory; share memory by communicating.

This means instead of using shared variables with locks, Go encourages passing data through channels.

## Creating a Channel

Creating a channel in Go is simple:

```go
channel := make(chan interface{})
```

This creates a channel that can send and receive values of any type (though it's usually better to use a specific type).

Here's a more typical example, creating a channel that handles string values:

```go
messages := make(chan string)
```

## Sending and Receiving

Channels use two primary operations:
- The send operation `chan <-` sends a value into a channel
- The receive operation `<-chan` receives a value from a channel

Let's see a simple example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Create a new channel
    messages := make(chan string)

    // Send a value into the channel (in a separate goroutine)
    go func() { 
        messages <- "ping" 
    }()

    // Receive the value from the channel
    msg := <-messages
    fmt.Println(msg)
}
```

When you run this program, you'll see the output:
```
ping
```

## Channel Blocking

Channels are inherently blocking. This means:

1. A send operation `channel <- value` blocks until a receiver is ready to receive the value
2. A receive operation `value := <-channel` blocks until a sender sends a value

This blocking behavior is what makes channels so powerful for synchronization between goroutines.

## Channel Types

There are different types of channels in Go:
- **Bidirectional channels**: The default type, can be both read from and written to
- **Directional channels**: Restricted to either sending or receiving
- **Buffered channels**: Can hold a limited number of values without a receiver being ready

In the next labs, we'll explore each of these types in detail.

## When to Use Channels

Channels are ideal for:

1. Communicating between goroutines
2. Signaling completion of tasks
3. Distributing work among multiple goroutines
4. Managing concurrency with timeouts and cancellation

## Summary

- Channels are a communication mechanism between goroutines
- The syntax for creating a channel is `make(chan Type)`
- Send values with `channel <- value`
- Receive values with `value := <-channel`
- Channels block until the operation can proceed
- Channels provide built-in synchronization

In the next lab, we'll explore bidirectional channels in more detail.
