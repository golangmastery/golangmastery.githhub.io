# Working with WaitGroups

In the previous lab, we used `time.Sleep` to wait for goroutines to complete, but this approach is unreliable. A better way to synchronize goroutines is to use WaitGroups from the `sync` package.

## What is a WaitGroup?

A WaitGroup is a synchronization primitive that allows you to wait for a collection of goroutines to finish executing. It provides three main methods:

1. `Add(delta int)`: Adds delta (a positive or negative value) to the WaitGroup counter
2. `Done()`: Decrements the WaitGroup counter by 1
3. `Wait()`: Blocks until the WaitGroup counter is 0

## Basic Pattern

The basic pattern for using WaitGroups is:

1. Create a WaitGroup
2. Call `Add` to set the number of goroutines to wait for
3. Launch goroutines and have each call `Done` when finished
4. Call `Wait` to block until all goroutines are done

## Simple Example

Here's a simple example of using WaitGroups:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
)

func printSomething(s string, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
    // Ensure we call Done when this function returns
    defer wg.Done()
    
    fmt.Println(s)
}

func main() {
    // Create a WaitGroup
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    
    // Add the number of goroutines we'll wait for
    wg.Add(3)
    
    // Launch 3 goroutines
    go printSomething("First message", &wg)
    go printSomething("Second message", &wg)
    go printSomething("Third message", &wg)
    
    // Wait for all goroutines to finish
    wg.Wait()
    
    fmt.Println("All goroutines completed")
}
```

In this example:
1. We create a WaitGroup `wg`
2. We call `wg.Add(3)` to indicate we'll wait for 3 goroutines
3. We launch three goroutines, each calling `wg.Done()` when finished
4. We call `wg.Wait()` to block until all goroutines are done

## Processing a Collection with WaitGroups

Here's a more practical example that processes items from a slice:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
)

func processItem(i int, item string, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
    defer wg.Done()
    fmt.Printf("%d: %s\n", i, item)
}

func main() {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    
    words := []string{
        "one",
        "two",
        "five",
    }
    
    // Add the number of items we need to process
    wg.Add(len(words))
    
    // Launch a goroutine for each item
    for i, word := range words {
        go processItem(i, word, &wg)
    }
    
    // Wait for all processing to complete
    wg.Wait()
    
    fmt.Println("All items processed")
}
```

## Important Considerations

### 1. Always Pass WaitGroups by Pointer

WaitGroups must be passed by pointer. If you pass them by value, each goroutine gets a copy, and calling `Done()` on those copies won't affect the original WaitGroup.

```go
// Correct: passing by pointer
go someFunction(&wg)

// Incorrect: passing by value
go someFunction(wg)  // This won't work as expected
```

### 2. Call `Add` Before Launching Goroutines

Always call `Add` before launching the goroutines to avoid race conditions where `Wait` might return before all goroutines have started.

```go
// Correct
wg.Add(3)
go func1(&wg)
go func2(&wg)
go func3(&wg)

// Incorrect - race condition possible
go func1(&wg)  // wg.Add(1) might not happen before Wait() checks counter
go func2(&wg)
go func3(&wg)
```

### 3. Use `defer wg.Done()`

It's good practice to use `defer wg.Done()` at the beginning of your goroutine functions to ensure `Done()` is called even if the function panics.

```go
func worker(wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
    defer wg.Done()  // This will be called even if the function panics
    
    // Do work...
}
```

### 4. Balance Add and Done

Make sure the number of `Done()` calls matches the number of increments from `Add()`. If you call `Done()` too few times, `Wait()` will block forever. If you call it too many times, you'll get a panic.

## Advanced Example: WaitGroup with Message Passing

Here's a more advanced example that combines WaitGroups with channels for message passing:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
)

func updateMessage(s string, wg *sync.WaitGroup, m *string) {
    defer wg.Done()
    *m = s
}

func printMessage(m *string) {
    fmt.Println(*m)
}

func main() {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    msg := "Hello, world!"
    
    wg.Add(1)
    go updateMessage("Hello, One!", &wg, &msg)
    wg.Wait()
    printMessage(&msg)
    
    wg.Add(1)
    go updateMessage("Hello, two!", &wg, &msg)
    wg.Wait()
    printMessage(&msg)
    
    wg.Add(1)
    go updateMessage("Hello, three!", &wg, &msg)
    wg.Wait()
    printMessage(&msg)
}
```

In this example, we're using WaitGroups to ensure that each message update is completed before printing it.

## Summary

- WaitGroups provide a reliable way to wait for goroutines to complete
- The basic pattern is: Create, Add, Launch goroutines with Done, Wait
- Always pass WaitGroups by pointer
- Call Add before launching goroutines
- Use defer wg.Done() for safety
- Ensure Add and Done calls are balanced

WaitGroups are a fundamental synchronization mechanism in Go, and they're often combined with other concurrency patterns to build robust concurrent programs.

In the next lab, we'll learn how to write tests for concurrent code using WaitGroups.
