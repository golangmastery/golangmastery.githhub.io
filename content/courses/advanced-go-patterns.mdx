# Advanced Go Patterns

This course covers advanced design patterns and architectural approaches in Go programming. You'll learn how to structure large-scale applications, implement common design patterns, and leverage Go's concurrency features effectively.

## What You'll Learn

Throughout this course, you'll master advanced Go patterns including:

- Concurrency patterns and channels best practices
- Error handling strategies for robust applications
- Dependency injection and service locators
- Context package and timeout management
- Advanced testing strategies
- SOLID principles in Go

## Why This Matters

Understanding these patterns will help you write cleaner, more maintainable Go code, especially as your applications grow in complexity. These patterns form the backbone of professional Go development.

## Hands-on Labs

This course includes practical labs where you'll implement these patterns in real-world scenarios. Each lab reinforces the concepts covered in the lectures and gives you hands-on experience applying these patterns.
