# Your First Go Program

<Callout type="info">
  This lab will guide you through writing your first Go program and understanding the basic structure of Go code.
</Callout>

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Set up a Go development environment
- Create and run a simple Go program
- Understand the basic structure of a Go program
- Use the `fmt` package for output

## Introduction

Go (or Golang) is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google. It's known for its simplicity, efficiency, and built-in concurrency features. In this lab, we'll write our first Go program and explore the basic structure of Go code.

## Setup

<Step number="1" title="Set up your environment">
  First, make sure you have Go installed on your system. You can check by running:

  <Terminal>
  go version
  </Terminal>

  If Go is not installed, follow the instructions on the [official Go website](https://golang.org/doc/install).
</Step>

<Step number="2" title="Create a new project">
  Create a new directory for your project:

  <Terminal>
  mkdir hello-world
  cd hello-world
  </Terminal>

  Initialize a new Go module:

  <Terminal>
  go mod init example.com/hello-world
  </Terminal>

  This creates a `go.mod` file that defines your module and its dependencies.
</Step>

## Writing Your First Go Program

<Step number="3" title="Create your first Go file">
  Create a new file called `main.go` with the following content:

  ```go
  package main

  import "fmt"

  func main() {
      fmt.Println("Hello, Go!")
  }
  ```

  Let's break down this code:

  <ul>
    <li>`package main`: Every Go file starts with a package declaration. The `main` package is special - it defines an executable program rather than a library.</li>
    <li>`import "fmt"`: This imports the `fmt` package, which contains functions for formatted I/O.</li>
    <li>`func main()`: The `main` function is the entry point of your program. When you run your program, execution starts here.</li>
    <li>`fmt.Println("Hello, Go!")`: This calls the `Println` function from the `fmt` package to print text to the console.</li>
  </ul>
</Step>

<Step number="4" title="Run your program">
  Run your program using the `go run` command:

  <Terminal>
  go run main.go
  </Terminal>

  You should see the output:

  <Terminal>
  Hello, Go!
  </Terminal>

  Congratulations! You've just written and run your first Go program.
</Step>

## Building Your Program

<Step number="5" title="Build an executable">
  The `go run` command compiles and runs your program in one step. To build an executable file that you can run later, use the `go build` command:

  <Terminal>
  go build
  </Terminal>

  This creates an executable file named after your module (in this case, `hello-world` or `hello-world.exe` on Windows).

  Run the executable:

  <Terminal>
  ./hello-world  # On Unix-like systems
  hello-world.exe  # On Windows
  </Terminal>

  You should see the same output as before:

  <Terminal>
  Hello, Go!
  </Terminal>
</Step>

## Adding More Functionality

<Step number="6" title="Enhance your program">
  Let's modify our program to make it more interactive. Update `main.go` with the following code:

  ```go
  package main

  import (
      "fmt"
      "time"
  )

  func main() {
      name := "Gopher"
      currentTime := time.Now()

      fmt.Println("Hello,", name + "!")
      fmt.Println("The current time is:", currentTime.Format("15:04:05"))

      // Using Printf for formatted output
      fmt.Printf("Today is %s, %d %s %d\n",
          currentTime.Weekday(),
          currentTime.Day(),
          currentTime.Month(),
          currentTime.Year())
  }
  ```

  This enhanced program:

  <ul>
    <li>Imports the `time` package to work with dates and times</li>
    <li>Uses variables to store a name and the current time</li>
    <li>Demonstrates string concatenation with the `+` operator</li>
    <li>Uses `Printf` for formatted output with placeholders</li>
  </ul>
</Step>

<Step number="7" title="Run the enhanced program">
  Run your enhanced program:

  <Terminal>
  go run main.go
  </Terminal>

  You should see output similar to this (with the current date and time):

  <Terminal>
  Hello, Gopher!
  The current time is: 14:30:45
  Today is Monday, 15 May 2023
  </Terminal>
</Step>

## Exercises

Now it's your turn to practice what you've learned. Complete the following exercises:

### Exercise 1: Personalize the greeting

Modify the program to ask for the user's name and then greet them.

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

  ```go
  package main

  import (
      "bufio"
      "fmt"
      "os"
      "strings"
      "time"
  )

  func main() {
      // Create a reader to read from standard input
      reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)

      // Prompt for name
      fmt.Print("Enter your name: ")

      // Read the input until a newline
      name, _ := reader.ReadString('\n')

      // Trim whitespace (including the newline)
      name = strings.TrimSpace(name)

      // Get current time
      currentTime := time.Now()

      // Greet the user
      fmt.Println("Hello,", name + "!")
      fmt.Println("The current time is:", currentTime.Format("15:04:05"))

      // Using Printf for formatted output
      fmt.Printf("Today is %s, %d %s %d\n",
          currentTime.Weekday(),
          currentTime.Day(),
          currentTime.Month(),
          currentTime.Year())
  }
  ```
</details>

### Exercise 2: Add a custom greeting based on the time of day

Extend the program to provide a different greeting based on the time of day (morning, afternoon, evening).

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

  ```go
  package main

  import (
      "bufio"
      "fmt"
      "os"
      "strings"
      "time"
  )

  func main() {
      // Create a reader to read from standard input
      reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)

      // Prompt for name
      fmt.Print("Enter your name: ")

      // Read the input until a newline
      name, _ := reader.ReadString('\n')

      // Trim whitespace (including the newline)
      name = strings.TrimSpace(name)

      // Get current time
      currentTime := time.Now()
      hour := currentTime.Hour()

      // Determine greeting based on time of day
      var greeting string
      if hour < 12 {
          greeting = "Good morning"
      } else if hour < 18 {
          greeting = "Good afternoon"
      } else {
          greeting = "Good evening"
      }

      // Greet the user
      fmt.Printf("%s, %s!\n", greeting, name)
      fmt.Println("The current time is:", currentTime.Format("15:04:05"))

      // Using Printf for formatted output
      fmt.Printf("Today is %s, %d %s %d\n",
          currentTime.Weekday(),
          currentTime.Day(),
          currentTime.Month(),
          currentTime.Year())
  }
  ```

## Challenge (Optional)

For an extra challenge, try to implement a program that:

- Asks the user for their birth year
- Calculates and displays their age
- Tells them if it's their birthday today

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

  ```go
  package main

  import (
      "bufio"
      "fmt"
      "os"
      "strconv"
      "strings"
      "time"
  )

  func main() {
      reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)

      // Get current time
      currentTime := time.Now()
      currentYear := currentTime.Year()

      // Prompt for birth year
      fmt.Print("Enter your birth year: ")
      birthYearStr, _ := reader.ReadString('\n')
      birthYearStr = strings.TrimSpace(birthYearStr)

      // Convert string to integer
      birthYear, err := strconv.Atoi(birthYearStr)
      if err != nil {
          fmt.Println("Invalid year. Please enter a valid number.")
          return
      }

      // Calculate age
      age := currentYear - birthYear

      // Display age
      fmt.Printf("You are approximately %d years old.\n", age)

      // Prompt for birth month and day
      fmt.Print("Enter your birth month (1-12): ")
      birthMonthStr, _ := reader.ReadString('\n')
      birthMonthStr = strings.TrimSpace(birthMonthStr)

      fmt.Print("Enter your birth day (1-31): ")
      birthDayStr, _ := reader.ReadString('\n')
      birthDayStr = strings.TrimSpace(birthDayStr)

      // Convert to integers
      birthMonth, err1 := strconv.Atoi(birthMonthStr)
      birthDay, err2 := strconv.Atoi(birthDayStr)

      if err1 != nil || err2 != nil || birthMonth < 1 || birthMonth > 12 || birthDay < 1 || birthDay > 31 {
          fmt.Println("Invalid date. Skipping birthday check.")
          return
      }

      // Check if today is their birthday
      if currentTime.Month() == time.Month(birthMonth) && currentTime.Day() == birthDay {
          fmt.Println("ðŸŽ‰ Happy Birthday! ðŸŽ‚")
      } else {
          fmt.Println("Today is not your birthday.")
      }
  }
  ```
