# RESTful API with Gin Framework

In this project, you'll build a RESTful API using the Gin web framework. Gin is a high-performance HTTP web framework written in Go that makes it easy to build web applications and microservices.

## Project Overview

You'll create a RESTful API for a simple book management system that allows users to:

- Create new books
- Retrieve books (single book or all books)
- Update existing books
- Delete books
- Authenticate users
- Implement middleware for logging and authentication

## What You'll Learn

By completing this project, you'll learn:

- How to use the Gin web framework
- How to design and implement a RESTful API
- How to handle JSON data
- How to implement CRUD operations
- How to use middleware for cross-cutting concerns
- How to implement basic authentication

## Prerequisites

To complete this project, you should have:

- Basic knowledge of Go programming
- Understanding of HTTP and RESTful API concepts
- Familiarity with JSON

## Project Structure

The project is divided into several steps:

1. Setting up the project and installing Gin
2. Creating the book data structure
3. Implementing CRUD operations
4. Adding middleware for logging
5. Implementing authentication
6. Testing the API with curl or Postman

## Getting Started

Let's start by setting up the project and installing the Gin framework.

```go
package main

import (
    "net/http"
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

type Book struct {
    ID     string `json:"id"`
    Title  string `json:"title"`
    Author string `json:"author"`
    Year   int    `json:"year"`
}

var books = []Book{
    {ID: "1", Title: "The Go Programming Language", Author: "Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan", Year: 2015},
    {ID: "2", Title: "Go in Action", Author: "William Kennedy", Year: 2015},
    {ID: "3", Title: "Concurrency in Go", Author: "Katherine Cox-Buday", Year: 2017},
}

func main() {
    router := gin.Default()

    // We'll implement the API endpoints here

    router.Run(":8080")
}
```

Follow the step-by-step instructions in this project to build your own RESTful API with Gin!
