# Build a CLI Task Manager

In this project, you'll build a command-line task manager application using Go. This project will help you apply your Go knowledge to create a practical tool that you can use in your daily life.

## Project Overview

You'll create a CLI application that allows users to:

- Add new tasks
- List all tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks
- Save tasks to a file
- Load tasks from a file

## What You'll Learn

By completing this project, you'll learn:

- How to create a command-line interface in Go
- How to handle user input
- How to work with files for data persistence
- How to structure a Go application
- How to use Go's standard library

## Prerequisites

To complete this project, you should have:

- Basic knowledge of Go programming
- Understanding of functions and data structures in Go
- Familiarity with error handling in Go

## Project Structure

The project is divided into several steps:

1. Setting up the project
2. Creating the task data structure
3. Implementing task operations (add, list, complete, delete)
4. Adding file persistence
5. Building the command-line interface
6. Testing and refining the application

## Getting Started

Let's start by setting up the project structure and creating the task data structure.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
    "time"
)

type Task struct {
    ID        int
    Title     string
    Completed bool
    CreatedAt time.Time
}

type TaskManager struct {
    Tasks []Task
    NextID int
}

func NewTaskManager() *TaskManager {
    return &TaskManager{
        Tasks: []Task{},
        NextID: 1,
    }
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Task Manager")
    // We'll implement the main functionality here
}
```

Follow the step-by-step instructions in this project to build your own CLI task manager!
