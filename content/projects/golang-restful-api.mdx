# Building a RESTful API with Go

In this project, you'll learn how to build a complete RESTful API using Go and popular libraries.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this project, you'll have created a fully functional API that can:

- Handle CRUD operations
- Implement proper authentication
- Use middleware for logging and error handling
- Connect to a database

## Technology Stack

We'll be using:

- Go (1.18+)
- Gin Web Framework
- GORM for database operations
- PostgreSQL

## Getting Started

First, let's set up the basic project structure and dependencies:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
    "log"
)

func main() {
    r := gin.Default()
    
    r.GET("/ping", func(c *gin.Context) {
        c.JSON(200, gin.H{
            "message": "pong",
        })
    })
    
    if err := r.Run(":8080"); err != nil {
        log.Fatal("Failed to start server:", err)
    }
}
```
