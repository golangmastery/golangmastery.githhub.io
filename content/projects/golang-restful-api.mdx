# Building a RESTful API with Gin Framework

In this project, you'll build a complete RESTful API using Gin, a popular web framework for Go. You'll implement all the CRUD operations, error handling, middleware, and JWT authentication.

## Project Overview

The API you'll build will be a simple task management system with the following features:

- User registration and authentication
- Creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks
- Assigning tasks to users
- Marking tasks as complete

## What You'll Learn

- How to structure a web API in Go
- Using the Gin framework for routing and middleware
- Implementing JWT authentication
- Connecting to a database with GORM
- Testing API endpoints
- Error handling best practices

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Go
- Understanding of HTTP and REST principles
- Familiarity with databases (PostgreSQL will be used)
